## Hello World!

It's a blog! I've decided to start documenting some things I've learned from my experience in building and deploying web applications at scale.  The internet has provided me free job training on a regular basis and I felt this was a way I could help give back to the community.  

The focus will be on the things I do from a day to day basis: continous integration, software deployment, configuration management and operations.  If you want to learn more about me feel free to checkout the about section.  I have yet to setup a comments section, if you have any please send them my way via a direct message on twitter @stevemiskiewicz
