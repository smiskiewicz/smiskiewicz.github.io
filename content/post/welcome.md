## Hello World!

It's a blog! I've decided to document some of the adventures I've had in building, deploying, and operating web applications at scale.  

The focus will be on the things I do from a day to day basis: continous integration, software deployment, configuration management and operations.  If you want to learn more about me feel free to checkout the about section.  I have yet to setup a comments section, if you have any please send them my way via a direct message on twitter @stevemiskiewicz
