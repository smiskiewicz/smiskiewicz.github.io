I'm a dude.

I've worked in software for almost a decade working on Continious Integration, Software Deployment, Operations, Testing and automating all kinds of things.  I'm currently focused on a microservices architecture and all the joys and horrors that come with it.  Posts will be about the tools and tech I deal with every day.

The internet has provided me free job training, code, operating systems, and tools on a daily basis.  Since the community has given me so much, I felt this blog was a way that I could help give back to the community.

This blog is running on github pages.  To generate the html I'm using hugo and publishing is done via travis ci.  One of these days I'll write up the process for it.  I recommend all these things, they are free and awesome tools.  Here is my attempt at the legal stuff.  All of my code is free to use, if you want to re-post info from this blog you are free to do so, I just ask to please note this site as a source.  It's the nice thing to do.
