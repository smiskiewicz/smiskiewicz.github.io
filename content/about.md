I'm a dude.

I've worked in software for almost a decade working on Continious Integration, Software Deployment, Operations, Testing and automating all kinds of things.  I've currently been focused on a microservices architecture and all the joys that come with it, good and bad.  Posts will probably be about the tools and tech I deal with every day.  So expect some fun Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible posts.

Here is my attempt at the legal stuff.  All of my code is free to use, if you want to post about it yourself please note this site as a source.
